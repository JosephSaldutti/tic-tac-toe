# tic-tac-toe
Autonomous Tic Tac Toe.

Bugs:
  - should go in corner when X goes in the middle, not working for some reason
  - User is allowed to play on squares that have already been played on
  - Every time all marks are redrawn (lines get slightly thicker)
  - allows invladid inputs and will throw an InputMismatchException
